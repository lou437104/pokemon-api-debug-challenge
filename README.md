# üêõ Pok√©mon Finder ‚Äì Debugging Challenge

This project began as a deliberately broken version of a simple Pok√©mon search app. The goal was to simulate real-world debugging conditions by fixing a wide range of issues across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## üîß Project Description

The original code was full of intentional bugs, including:
- HTML structural problems
- CSS syntax and styling issues
- JavaScript errors in logic, API handling, and DOM manipulation

I went through the code line-by-line, identified each bug, and fixed them to build a fully working application that:
- Lets users search for a Pok√©mon by name
- Fetches data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Displays the Pok√©mon‚Äôs name and image
- Handles invalid input gracefully

---

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

- Corrected HTML element structure (e.g. heading tags, self-closing inputs)
- Fixed broken CSS syntax (`text-align center`, missing `px`, missing semicolons)
- Debugged JavaScript errors:
  - Typos in method names (`getElementByID`, `toLowercase`)
  - Broken API URL
  - Incorrect use of `.text`, `.innerHTML`, and selectors
  - Proper error handling using `.catch()`

## üí° Skills Practiced

- Manual bug tracking and resolution
- DOM manipulation and input handling
- Fetching and displaying API data
- Clean coding practices and accessibility improvements
- Writing helpful commit messages to track debugging progress

---

## üß† Educational Purpose

This was a personal learning exercise to practice **debugging real-world front-end issues**. Each fix was made intentionally and committed separately to reinforce:
- Isolating bugs efficiently
- Reading code critically
- Developing resilience during frustrating bugs (e.g. missing comma bugs!)

## üß™ Technologies Used

- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)
